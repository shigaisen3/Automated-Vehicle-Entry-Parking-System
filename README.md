Introduction
This project implements an Automated Vehicle Entry Parking System utilizing ultrasonic sensors to detect incoming and outgoing
vehicles. When a car approaches the entrance of the parking lot,
the ultrasonic sensors detect its presence, and if there are available
parking spaces, the system activates a servomotor to raise the barrier, allowing the car to enter. Subsequently, when a car approaches
the exit of the parking lot, the sensors detect its presence, and the
system raises the barrier to allow the car to exit. Simultaneously,
another sensor at the exit monitors when the car has left the lot, enabling the system to increase the count of available parking spaces.
 Description of Development Boards
The project utilizes Arduino Mega development boards. Arduino Mega is a
microcontroller board based on the ATmega2560. It has 54 digital input/output
pins (of which 15 can be used as PWM outputs), 16 analog inputs, 4 UARTs
(hardware serial ports), a 16 MHz crystal oscillator, a USB connection, a power
jack, an ICSP header, and a reset button.
